Project Overview
This full-stack application integrates a React frontend with a Node.js backend using Express, Apollo Server for GraphQL, and Prisma ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database. The application is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable platform for web application development.

Technologies Used
Frontend: Vite, React, Axios, Apollo Client
Backend: Node.js, Express, Apollo Server, Prisma ORM
Database: PostgreSQL
Other Services: (Optional integrations like Redis for caching, and authentication services)
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Node.js
npm or pnpm
PostgreSQL
Git (for version control)
Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
Set Up the BackendNavigate to the backend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd packages/backend
pnpm install
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
pnpm start
Set Up the FrontendNavigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd packages/frontend
pnpm install
Start the frontend server:
bash
Copy code
pnpm run dev
Environment VariablesEnsure you have the correct .env files set up in your backend for database connections and other environment-specific settings.
Running the Tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:

bash
Copy code
